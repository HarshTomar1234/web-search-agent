# Medical Researcher Web Search Agent: Development Journey
# A comprehensive documentation of the process of creating a web search agent for medical researcher information

# =======================================================================
# SECTION 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW
# =======================================================================

# The Medical Researcher Web Search Agent is a tool designed to extract, consolidate, and present 
# detailed information about medical researchers from multiple reliable sources. The agent functions 
# as an AI-powered search and data extraction tool that:

# 1. Accepts input from CSV files containing researcher information
# 2. Searches multiple medical and academic websites for researcher information
# 3. Consolidates data from all sources into a comprehensive profile
# 4. Enhances the data using OpenAI's GPT models
# 5. Provides a user-friendly interface for querying and exploring researcher information
# 6. Answers natural language questions about researchers

# The primary goal of this project is to create a tool that can quickly gather and structure information 
# about medical researchers, saving time for professionals who need comprehensive insights about 
# researchers, their work, publications, and contributions to the medical field.

# =======================================================================
# SECTION 2: ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW
# =======================================================================

# The system is built with a clear separation of concerns, dividing functionality into two main components:

# 1. Backend Agent (medical_researcher_agent.py)
#    - Core search and data extraction functionality
#    - Web scraping capabilities for multiple research websites
#    - Data consolidation and structuring
#    - Integration with OpenAI for data enhancement
#    - Question answering functionality

# 2. Web Interface (app.py)
#    - FastAPI-based web application
#    - User interface for interacting with the agent
#    - File upload functionality
#    - API endpoints for search and question answering
#    - Responsive design for various devices

# This separation allows for flexibility in deployment and future enhancements. The agent
# could be integrated into different interfaces or used as a standalone module if needed.

# =======================================================================
# SECTION 3: DATA SOURCES AND COLLECTION
# =======================================================================

# The agent collects information from multiple sources:

# 1. CSV Data:
#    - Allows users to upload structured data about researchers
#    - Provides a foundation that web scraping can enhance
#    - Useful for custom, proprietary, or hard-to-find information

# 2. Web Sources:
#    - PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov): Medical publications and research papers
#    - ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net): Academic profiles and connections
#    - Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com): Citations and academic impact
#    - ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov): Clinical trial involvement

# Data Collection Process:
# 1. Agent searches each source using the researcher's name (and optionally, specialization)
# 2. Extracts structured data from search results and researcher profiles
# 3. Each source has a specialized extraction method tailored to its HTML structure
# 4. Data is collected asynchronously using ThreadPoolExecutor for efficiency
# 5. All data is normalized into a consistent structure

# Scraping Techniques:
# - BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
# - Respectful crawling with appropriate headers and delays
# - Error handling for rate limiting and other issues
# - Selective extraction to avoid overloading the sources

# =======================================================================
# SECTION 4: DATA ENHANCEMENT WITH AI
# =======================================================================

# Raw data from web scraping can be fragmented and lacks cohesion. To address this, the agent uses 
# OpenAI's GPT models to enhance and synthesize the collected information.

# Enhancement Process:
# 1. Collected data is formatted into a structured prompt
# 2. The prompt asks the model to:
#    - Summarize the researcher's background and expertise
#    - Identify key research contributions
#    - Extract additional insights about their career and impact
#    - Note potential research networks and collaborations
# 3. The model returns this information in JSON format
# 4. Enhanced data is integrated with the raw data

# Benefits of AI Enhancement:
# - Creates a narrative summary from fragmented information
# - Identifies patterns and connections not explicitly stated
# - Provides context for understanding the researcher's work
# - Makes the information more accessible and comprehensible

# The AI enhancement is optional and requires an OpenAI API key. This design allows
# users to choose whether to use this feature based on their needs and resources.

# =======================================================================
# SECTION 5: QUESTION ANSWERING CAPABILITIES
# =======================================================================

# One of the most powerful features of the agent is its ability to answer natural language 
# questions about researchers using the collected and enhanced data.

# Question Answering Process:
# 1. User submits a question about a specific researcher
# 2. Agent retrieves the collected data for that researcher
# 3. Data is formatted into context for the OpenAI model
# 4. Question and context are sent to the model
# 5. Model generates a detailed answer based on available information

# Types of Questions Supported:
# - Background and education of the researcher
# - Research focus and specializations
# - Notable publications and their significance
# - Clinical trial involvement
# - Research impact and citations
# - Collaborations and academic networks
# - Career trajectory and achievements

# The system is designed to acknowledge the limitations of its information. If data
# is not available to answer a specific question, it will clearly indicate this rather
# than generating potentially incorrect information.
